I've always wanted to develop a game, especially about hacking. None of that Hollywood mashing keyboard, flying popups on screen, or cheesy dialogue like "I'm in." Something right in the middle; fun, but also based on reality. Hard, but also easy once you get the hang of things. I can't show you much yet, as the project is in an alpha state. I'm hopeful for a summer release. If you're curious about how the dev journey is going, a couple of my friends and I are running a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linebreak/) where I upload teases from time to time.

I'll keep you posted!
